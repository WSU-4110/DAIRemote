## Running the Android Application
### Option 1 (Using BlueStacks):
* Download [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html)
* Navigate to the folder where the APK file is stored (e.g. DAIRemoteApp/app/build/outputs/apk/debug)
* Right-click on the APK file and select "Open with BlueStacks" and the Android app should run.

### Option 2 (Command Line):
1. **Ensure Android SDK is in PATH**:
   - Check if the SDK is located at:
     ```
     C:\Users\<yourUser>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
     ```
   - Replace `<yourUser>` with your user.  
   - If necessary, add this path to your system environment variables.
2. **Add Emulator Path**:
   - Add the following path to your system PATH variable:
     ```
     C:\Users\<yourUser>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\emulator
     ```
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DAIRemoteApp
   ```
4. **Build the APK using Gradle**:
   - Android Studio projects use Gradle to build the APK. Use the following command to build your project:
   ```bash
   gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
6. **List All Available AVDs**:
   ```bash
   emulator -list-avds
   ```
   - If no AVDs are available, you will need to create one. You can find a tutorial on creating an AVD [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rCNc3uhLJE).
7. **Run the Emulator**
   ```bash
   emulator -avd <yourAVD>
   ```
   - Replace `<yourAVD>` with the name of the AVD you wish to run.

### Option 3 (Using Smartphone):
1. On your smartphone, go to **Settings<About Phone<Software Information**
   - Tap on "Build Number" 7 times in a row to enable **Developer Mode**.
2. Exit back to the Settings Page and go to **Developer Options**
   - Connect your phone to your PC using a USB cable and click on **USB Debugging** to enable it.
3. **Open Android Studio**
   - Now run the app ensuring the virtual device paired is with yours.
   - The Android applicationa should appear on your smartphone, ready to be used. 


## Debugging
If you encounter an error after running `gradlew assembleDebug` related to having an older version of Java, follow these steps:
1. Install Java 17 from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
2. After installation, open your environment variables settings:
   - Go to the **System Properties**.
   - Click on **Environment Variables**.
3. Check if the `JAVA_HOME` variable is present. If not, add it:
   - Create a new system variable with the following:
     - **Variable name**: `JAVA_HOME`
     - **Variable value**: Path to your JDK 17 installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`).
4. Edit the `PATH` variable:
   - Replace the existing path that points to the older JDK (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-11.0.16.101-hotspot\bin`) with `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`.

After completing these steps, try running `gradlew assembleDebug` again.
